# Weather App
A web app that allows you to view the current weather and the 3-day forecast based on your current location.

Demo link: [https://bethqiang.github.io/weather-app](https://bethqiang.github.io/weather-app)

Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, [the Dark Sky Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io/), and [the Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro).

Current functionalities include:
* Automatically detect location by city and state.
* View the current and "feels like" temperature.
* View the current conditions, with an icon that changes depending on the conditions.
* View a 3-day forecast with conditions and chance of rain. If between 12am and 6am, the first day in the forecast will be that current day.
* Change units of all temperatures by toggling between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Future ideas include:
* View current day and time.
* Include chance of high and low, chance of rain, and wind speed at current time.
* Search for the weather at any location in the world.
* View hour-by-hour (or every-3-hours?) temperatures and chances of rain.
